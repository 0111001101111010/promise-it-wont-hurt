Write a program that prints "HELLO WORLD"

-----------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

To make a Node.js program, creat blah blah blah....

You can write to the console the same way as in the browser:

  console.log("text")

When you are done, you must run:

  {appname} verify myprogram.js

Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, 
and the lesson will be marked "completed" if you are successful.
